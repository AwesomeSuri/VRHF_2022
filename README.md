# VRHF_2022
 Exercise to the "Virtual Reality in Human Factors Research" lecture.

# Notes:
 - My code slightly differs from the code proposed in the exercise script. But I try to comment everything in the code.

# Known issues:
 - I didn't manage to create trees bended by wind. I suppose that URP doesn't fully support the Speed tree shaders (yet). That's why the trees in the scene are static. Also: The Tree component in the tree objects is very fragile. So don't touch it! It might break the shader fixes I did.
